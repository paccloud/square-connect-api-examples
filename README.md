## Release notes

### 2018-08-15
All V2 examples have been updated to remove vulnerable libraries and to ensure
consistency between examples.

### 2018-08-13

Updating directory structure and submitting inaugural code templates.

### 2017-05-23

On 23 May 2017, we improved our SDKs to expand their functionality and make them
easier to use. Unfortunately, some of the changes are not backward compatible.
You can read more about the changes in our [SDK blog post].


### 2016-02-16

On 16 February 2016, we changed the way merchant data is represented in the
Connect APIs. The data change also altered API behavior slightly. The samples
in this repository reflect this altered behavior. If you created your Connect
API application *before* 16 February, you can find samples that reflect your
application's behavior in the `v1` directory.
