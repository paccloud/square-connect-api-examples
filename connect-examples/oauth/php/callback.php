# This sample demonstrates a bare-bones implementation of the Square Connect OAuth flow:
#
# 1. A merchant clicks the authorization link served by the root path (http://localhost:8000/)
# 2. The merchant signs in to Square and submits the Permissions form. Note that if the merchant
#    is already signed in to Square, and if the merchant has already authorized your application,
#    the OAuth flow automatically proceeds to the next step without presenting the Permissions form.
# 3. Square sends a request to your application's Redirect URL
#    (which should be set to http://localhost:8080/callback.php on your application dashboard)
# 4. The server extracts the authorization code provided in Square's request and passes it
#    along to the Obtain Token endpoint.
# 5. The Obtain Token endpoint returns an access token your application can use in subsequent requests
#    to the Connect API.
#
# This sample requires the Unirest PHP library. Follow the instructions in README.md
# to install it.
