# Deprecated Example
**This Sample Application has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.** 
The use of `CreateCheckout` is a deprecated pattern and we now suggest using the `CreatePaymentLink` [endpoint](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/checkout-api/create-payment-link). More information [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/checkout-api)

### Square Checkout Demo

This is a simple example application that utilizes Square's Checkout API. This examples does assume you are familiar with PHP development.

It takes a single payment, declared by the user, and creates an order to use in the Checkout API.

### Setup

#### Requirements

- 8.0 <= PHP

#### Install the PHP client library

This sample already includes the `square/square` dependency in its `composer.json` file. To install the client library:

1. Make sure you've downloaded Composer, following the instructions
   [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. Run the following command from the directory containing `composer.json`:

```
php composer.phar install
```

#### Specify your application credentials

In order for the example to work, you must create a new file `.env` by copying the contents of the `.env.example` file. Edit this file with your application credentials and environment configuration.

Open your [developer dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/). Now supply either production, sandbox, or both credentials. Open this file and update the following variables:

- WARNING: never upload .env with your credential/access_token

| Variable              | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | :------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ENVIRONMENT           | `string` | `production` or `sandbox` depending on what type of endpoint you want to hit. For testing purposes please use the sandbox mode (already configured in the `.env`) |
| SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID | `string` | Application ID found on your Developer App Dashboard, Credentials tab. Must match the corresponding `ENVIRONMENT`.                                                |
| SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN   | `string` | Access Token found at the Developer App Dashboard, Credentials tab. Must match the corresponding `ENVIRONMENT`.                                                   |
| SQUARE_LOCATION_ID    | `string` | Location found at the Developer App Dashboard, Location tab. Must match the corresponding `ENVIRONMENT`.                                                          |
